,2017,Switching card transaction in Europe: An interview with Ernst Verbe다,"According to the European Central Bank, more than 780 million payments card were in circulation in Europe by the end of 2015; in turn, these card had been used to process more than 52 billion transaction. Card switching is the domain that sits between the issuer and the acquirer when a transaction is processed, and that domain is often overlooked. The switching domain is under constant change: acquirers and, to a lesser extent, issuers are starting to support all card brands as long as there is a customer demand for them. Further, regulation is impacting switching. To talk about a European payments market is a misnomer as a single market does not exist in the way that it does for other industries. Market actors still have a very country-centric orientation, although it cannot be denied that this is changing, even if the talk of change far outweighs the change actually happening. It is safe to say, however, that the market, helped along by new regulation, is in a state of constant change. In this interview, Ernst Verbeek, CEO of Trionis, discusses the specifics of the payments card switching industry and the constant change impacting this domain.","SEPA for card, Trionis, card switching, ISC (international card schemes), EUFISERV, domestic card schemes, interbank-switching, card scheme"
,2017,Evolving a payments business to meet the demands of a distributed economy,"payments services are in the frontline of the ongoing digital technology revolution. Financial technology (FinTech) companies are breaking boundaries and offering services such as digital cash, cognitive system and distributed ledger technology to offer customers a more streamlined, user-friendly and cost-effective experience. Some traditional financial institutions are partnering with FinTech firms in an effort to be part of the digital revolution rather than be left behind. But such partnerships and experiments with financial technology products and services need to be managed carefully. This article discusses the current and future state of the payments innovation environment, key change drivers, disruptors, and considerations for a strategic transformative journey which balances speed of innovation with risk.","responsible innovation, transformation strategy, FinTech, risk management, blockchain, open APIs"
,2017,The future of payments: How FinTech players are accelerating customer-driven innovation in financial services,"Innovation in the financial services realm is happening at an ever-increasing pace. FinTech firms across the globe are playing a major role in using new technology and new business models to better align payments solutions with customer needs. Transformation is accelerating due to broad global trend around connected device and mobility as well as shifts in demographics and customer expectations. Shifting security concerns and point of sale technology changes further reinforce the environment of change. In this context, this paper addresses how the broader financial services landscape is impacted by major global shifts including: end-to-end commerce focus; advances in machine learning and analytics; mass customisation — loyalty, segmentation and new value propositions; and technology transformations in connectivity, efficiency and security.","payments, innovation, FinTech, customer-driven transformation, digital and mobile commerce, financial services"
,2017,Next generation payments: Alternative models or converging paths?,"The next generation of payments is upon us. This paper analyses the state of the industry through the framework of layers and concludes that although innovation is now permeating every layer, the drivers, the context and the outcomes are distinctly different — hence investment and adoption decisions must be unique to the specific layer. The paper also finds that the innovation at the lower levels has the potential for the most meaningful and lasting transformation of the industry.","payments, networks, convergence, layers, innovation"
,2017,Digitalisation: Shaping the retail payments markets while posing new challenges to authorities,"Digitalisation is shaping almost every sector of the economy, enabling new ways of doing things, not merely digitising old, often manual, processes. Numerous new digital payments applications have emerged in retail payments markets, but the underlying payments infrastructure have remained almost unchanged. However, it is expected that technological advances combined with increasing competition enhanced by regulatory changes will shape retail payments markets in the coming years. With this evolving new environment will come new requirements, most notably for the authorities responsible for safeguarding the security, reliability and efficiency of payments. To analyse this challenge, this paper first reviews the theoretical framework that can be applied in examining the development of retail payments markets. Based on this, it outlines possible policy actions for the authorities. Secondly, it assesses the roles of authorities in practice, focusing on their position as catalyst for development in the European and national payments landscapes. Finally, it draws policy conclusions, emphasising the importance of multistakeholder cooperation bodies involving both payments service users and providers as well as relevant authorities.","authority roles, cooperation, digitalisation, network industry, retail payments"
,2017,Fundamental competition and market practice impacts of real-time payments,"Real-time processing has long been employed in a variety of industries. In the retail payments industry, however, it has only just started. National-level implementation has begun in several countries and seems to be catching on, one country at a time. Real-time payments are mostly seen as an exercise in improved delivery speed. This paper analyses the more fundamental changes that the financial market will face due to immediate payments as well as the profound effects on economic incentives. Real-time payments will particularly affect competition between payments instruments and service providers. However, much wider impacts can be expected with respect to business and market practices in currency, money market, and security trading and settlement. Real-time payments will change the roles and business opportunities of many intermediaries and stakeholders in the payments and bank industry when infrastructure will become more ‘flat’ and based on direct end-to-end connections.","real-time payments, immediate payments, payments industry competition, payments instrument competition, payments system development"
,2017,The future of instant payments: Are we investing billions just for mobile peer-to-peer payments?,"The implementation of instant payments in Europe will most likely take many years and will require significant investments, as well as years’ worth of management attention at bank and regulators that could otherwise be devoted to other topics, notably innovation beyond infrastructure. Mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are already enjoying some success, notably in the UK, Sweden, USA and Kenya. However, countless attempts at mobile payments by digital disruptors, bank, mobile operators and others all over the world have largely failed. This paper analyses why successes are so rare, why they have so far only happened outside the Eurozone, and whether a true underlying instant infrastructure is necessary for them at all. Finally, it maps a success for the future: how the emergence of the new pan-European instant payments infrastructure may catapult Europe to the forefront of new services. Comparisons are made between policy decisions in Europe versus other geographies and the consequences therefrom. This paper widens the debate beyond the current focus on infrastructure and simple P2P applications. It argues that the success will come from a plethora of applications rather than infrastructure. Thus, the paper welcomes the advent of a pan-European (and increasingly global) instant payments infrastructure and aims to show that its real value comes in its application.","ECB, ERPB, instant payments, P2P, M2M, mobile payments"
,2017,Innovation in payments and the revised Payments Services Directive,"The payments industry is on the brink of huge change with the pending implementation of the revised EU Payments Services Directive. In the UK, this situation is complicated by the recent Brexit vote. Both the UK government and the bank will need to take steps to ensure that they are ready for the changes. This paper explains the detail of the upcoming regulatory changes and their impact.","payments, Payments Services Directive, PSD2, Brexit, regulation, EU law"
,2017,Collaboration and the sharing of information help reduce payments transaction fraud,"In recent years, the Netherlands has benefited from the voluntary cooperation between various parties that play a role in the payments chain. For example, knowledge and experience in the field of fraud prevention and cyber security are shared and exchanged, more research and threat analyses are conducted, and fraud mitigation measures are coordinated and implemented jointly. This domestic partnership is unique in Europe. The Dutch Payments Association manages the collective aspects of cyber security policy in relation to the payments system, and works closely with other institutions, including the National Cyber Security Centre, to implement this policy. It also coordinates fraud prevention within the entire payments chain, compiles and analyses statistics on fraud, and drafts prevention policy. In addition, it coordinates the implementation of measures designed to prevent fraud. This unique Dutch partnership limits cyber crime and fraud. Any payments chain is only as strong as its weakest link, however; therefore, cooperation between the various parties involved is vital to ensure and enhance security in the payments chain. This paper describes the Dutch approach to fighting fraud in the payments system.","cyber security, cyber crime, electronic payments, Netherlands, Europe, fraud figures"
,2017,"Automated teller machine fraud in south-west Nigeria: Victim typologies, victimisation strategies and fraud prevention","Extant studies have not examined the unintended consequences of automated teller machine (ATM) subscription, particularly factors making individuals susceptible to fraud. To address this gap in the literature, this study investigated ATM fraud victims in south-west Nigeria. Using the in-depth interview method, data were collected from 20 victims of ATM fraud in the states of Lagos and Oyo. The results showed that victims were young, elderly and included both males and females. Fraudsters were typically lovers, friends, relatives and sometimes the children of the victims. Card cloning, card swapping and physical attacks at ATMs were reported tactics for defrauding. Vulnerability factors included illiteracy, ill health, routine activity and time of withdrawal. As means of mitigating fraud, it was found that bank employed an assortment of strategies including, but not limited to, improvements in staff welfare, stringent penalties for culpable staff and enhanced fraud awareness through customer alerts. The paper reveals the limits of trust in cashless policy. It raises salient policy issues concerning the need for the governance of trust to engender adoption and ensure victim compensation.","fraud, victimisation, cashless policy"
,2017,Connecting the dots in e-commerce payments: An interview with Ralf Ohlhausen,"In Europe and other mature markets, things such as bank-transfer payments methods, e-wallet, prepaid card and mobile wallet are considered alternative payments methods. These also exist in developing markets but are the preserve of a minority of very high-net-worth consumers. More commonly in developing markets, alternative payments methods comprise such things as cash-payments schemes — which allow a user to shop online but pay at a participating store — and pre-paid mobile money apps. PPRO is a wholesaler of payments methods. It aggregates local payments methods and integrates them into its application programming interface (API). payments service providers, card acquirers and marketplaces work with PPRO, integrating the API with their system, so that they can provide their merchants with access to a whole range of local alternative payments methods. The European payments landscape is also under the continuous scrutiny of various actors, including regulators. In this interview, Ralf Ohlhausen discusses the specifics of the e-commerce payments industry and how recent developments are affecting the payments space.",AISP; Brexit; FinTech; PISP; PPRO; account information service provider; alternative payments methods; payments initiation service provider
,2017,Recognising and thwarting transaction and payments laundering,"The internet has facilitated economic growth, new mass retail models and financial inclusion for the under-banked and micro-businesses. At the same time, however, it also enables new avenues of crime. The ease with which goods can be sourced and distributed online has enabled cyber criminals to thrive. Their endeavours are severely compromised, however, when credit card networks and acquirers deny access to payments system. Criminals have adapted by utilising transaction laundering — the use of online ‘front’ businesses, and payments laundering — the use of alternative payments methods (APMs) with less mature risk policies. While credit card system have strict rules and processes, APMs like peer-to-peer, e-wallet and money transfer have less robust due diligence and monitoring practices. Perpetrators dubbed ‘payments hustlers’ rotate between different front businesses and different payments methods through trial-and-error until they gain safe passage into the payments system. bank and payments service providers can secure their operation through both organisational and technological best practices. Furthermore, rigorous due diligence can coexist with a smooth business customer onboarding experience.",alternative payments methods (APMs); cybercrime; e-commerce; fraud; money laundering; transaction laundering
,2017,Did the Target data breach change consumer assessments of payments card security?,"Previous research has found that perceptions of payments security affect consumers’ use of payments instruments. This study tests whether the Target data breach of 2013 had any impact on consumer perceptions of the security of credit and debit card and/or any impact on consumers’ use of payments card. Using data from the Survey of Consumer payments Choice, the study finds that, controlling for possible confounding effects of demographic differences between the two groups, ratings by consumers who assessed the personal information security of debit card shortly after the breach were lower than ratings by consumers who responded before the breach was reported. For credit card, there was no difference in the ratings given by consumers who responded to the survey before the breach was reported and the ratings of those who responded after the breach was reported. Based on prior research on the impact of security assessments on payments instrument use, one would expect a small (economically insignificant) decline in debit card use from this lower rating. However, the study finds no statistically or economically significant change in debit card use from 2013 to 2014.",Survey of Consumer payments Choice; Target; credit card; data breach; debit card; payments card security
,2017,The Federal Reserve and faster payments: ‘Umbrella’ or ‘rails’?,"This paper analyses the responses to the US Federal Reserve’s public consultation on faster payments. It uses an inductive approach to identify emergent issues and stakeholder alignment around two issues: the role of the Federal Reserve in a new payments system and the design of a new payments system. There is little support for a publicly provided faster payments system and the ‘operator’ role of the Federal Reserve is likely to decline with the transition to electronic payments. The private sector views faster payments as a new channel rather than network infrastructure and is hesitant to invest in a new system without a business case. Americans will have to wait until 2018 for same-day payments via their bank account and much longer for near real-time payments, meaning the USA will, in this regard, fall further behind many developing and developed countries. Innovation will be limited to the consumer-facing interface and more closedloop networks will emerge in the short term. The coordination failure also leaves more room for firms seeking to disrupt the payments rails.",Federal Reserve; fast payments; immediate funds transfer; near real-time payments; payments system improvement; same-day ACH
,2017,Central bank money and blockchain: A payments perspective,"Although distributed ledger technology (DLT, aka ‘blockchain’) is associated with high production costs and low capacity, it represents a practical solution for ‘electronic cash’ and a starting point for the innovation of new kinds of transaction in digitised economies. Among other institutions, the European Central Bank is committed to exploring the potential of such new technology. This paper provides a first reflection of central bank money on blockchain, and evaluates the possible scenarios. It argues that the digitisation of central bank money (backed by trust) via DLT can open new perspectives on a digital economy with efficient and secure market infrastructure, linking new technological concepts with existing benefits.",blockchain; central bank money; distributed ledger technology; interoperability; payments system
,2017,Demonetisation for changing payments behaviour and building platforms,"Although mobile money is seen as the solution for financial inclusion, some countries have been facing challenges in the adoption of mobile wallet account. Slow adoption is linked to the perceived benefit of the mobile wallet, which, among other things, is informed by the cost of adoption. This paper discusses various issues relating to the pricing of mobile payments and how pricing decisions affect consumer adoption of mobile wallet in developing countries. It discusses how the demonetisation of digital payments instruments can positively affect the perceived utility and hence adoption of mobile payments, in addition to the associated network effects and implications for Big Data. It also suggests that FinTech are the best candidates to demonetise payments. It further explains how mobile wallet can be used as the foundations for applications and services that mobile financial service providers have been unable to provide by themselves.",behaviour change; digital payments; financial inclusion; mobile money; payments behaviour; payments pricing
,2017,Shifting the ticketing paradigm: The role of open standards,"This paper discusses the transit ticketing industry and the challenges it faces to evolve current system. Providing an overview of the key pressures facing public transport operators, the piece will investigate how single-vendor fare collection system are increasingly problematic and how the adoption of an open standard can bring new opportunities. The paper investigates how developments in internet of things (IoT), urban mobility and increasingly ‘smart cities’ are forcing transit ticketing to look beyond public transport. The need to develop multi-application solutions and collaborate with adjacent ecosystems, including access control and payments, is crucial. Moreover, it will consider how host card emulation (HCE) technology will be central to effecting this change. This consumer-centric approach will facilitate consumer demand for greater functionality and ease of use, and allow public transport operators to tap into new revenue streams at low initial cost. Readers will learn how open standards are vital for the future of fare collection and the only way to truly realise the full benefits of adopting HCE in transport. The paper will discuss the OSPT Alliance’s market-leading standard, CIPURSE, and its ability to both meet the challenges facing transport operators in the short term and provide scope for future developments and scalable long-term deployments.",AFC; HCE; open standards; ticketing; transit; urban mobility
,2017,The leakage of passwords from home bank sites: A threat to global cyber security?,"E-bank system rely on browsers and other financial applications to provide a secure service. As this paper shows, however, many e-bank system fail to provide the requisite level of confidentiality. This paper focuses on vulnerabilities related to the leakage of login information from the client side. It demonstrates that by using forensic techniques and tools, it was possible to acquire login-related data from a number of websites. This proves that important authentication data used in navigation activities remain on disk, posing a clear threat to confidentiality.",bank account leakage data; browser forensic analysis; credentials bank; credentials management; password management; privacy
,2017,Opportunities and challenges for the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme,"The SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme created by the European Payments Council and published in November 2016 came into force in November 2017. The scheme entails an innovative, fast and convenient method of payments for an international area that will ultimately encompass over 34 European countries. However, it also brings its share of challenges for payments service providers. This paper highlights the opportunities and difficulties raised by the scheme, and encourages all payments service providers to adhere to it as soon as possible. With the support of the European payments community, the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme can be a success and profoundly change payments as we know them.",clearing and settlement; innovation; instant payments; pan-European
,2017,State of play of mobile money on the African continent: An interview with Greg Reeve,"‘Mobile money’ is a generic term for the ability to deliver various financial services to customers via mobile device. More than half a billion mobile money account were registered as of the end of 2016, with more than 170 million active account around the globe. People can use a mobile money account to receive their salary payments, purchase their electricity and water, buy groceries, transfer money to people they owe, pay their bills, move money to a savings account, and if required, access the money as cash. There is good progress across Africa, led by Safaricom with M-Pesa who, in their financial year 2016–2017 results, reported 19 million active subscribers, with ten transaction per customer per month. The most critical point to recognise is that each market is different. Mobile money has for the most part been an initiative led by the mobile phone operators. Recently however, bank are providing similar looking services.

,2017,Mitigating cyber risk through information sharing,"The financial services sector has come a long way since the days of handwritten receipts and volumes of general ledger books. Paper has been replaced by bytes of data residing in corporate PCs and data centre servers. Malicious actors no longer arrive through the front doors of a financial institution to steal; rather, they leverage technology to identify and exploit vulnerabilities to attack people and machines to steal confidential information and line their own pockets. The increase of cyber attacks and regulatory cyber security requirements, combined with the limited resources of smaller institutions has created an opportunity for such institutions to proactively remediate threats before they can do harm. This paper shows how information sharing among a community of nearly 7,000 participants has proven to be a vital component in an institution’s information security management system and can enable an institution to adhere to regulatory guidelines and strengthen the maturity of its cyber security programme.",Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act 2015; Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center; Sheltered Harbor; bank regulations; compliance; cyber attacks; cyber security; information security management system; information sharing
,2017,Blockchain and payments system: What are the benefits and costs?,"The discussions of how blockchain technology (blocktech) will disintermediate or transform the payments business continue. To date, the discussion has largely focused on the possibility that, in the near future, the technology could enable a nominally priced, frictionless value transfer process. An examination of the benefits and costs indicates that, at the current level of maturity of technology and legal frameworks, blocktech is not superior to existing mechanisms, except in certain niche circumstances. This, coupled with the lack of viral adoption characterising recent successful adaptations (eg Facebook), indicate that major breakthroughs are required before there is wide adoption of this new paradigm in payments system.",Bitcoin; blockchain; blocktech; cryptocurrency; digital ledger; payments system

In particular, the study explores the pattern of innovation diffusion as a result of using multi-party integration needs/solutions. The study provides useful implications to support FinTech diffusion in the bank industry.",FinTech; bank industry; innovation diffusion; systematic innovation
,2017,The Internet of Things and the opportunity for payments,"The Internet of Things (IoT) will have a significant impact on many industries, from manufacturing to health and insurance. At first glance, the IoT’s impact on bank is less obvious. And yet, its potential for bank, and for the payments industry in particular, is significant. As device and entire platforms (eg cars) connect to the internet, they become conduits for commerce transaction and require payments capability. The IoT will change how commerce and transaction are conducted, and in turn will require changes in payments. This paper analyses the impact of the IoT on payments and bank. It discusses the opportunities and challenges the IoT evolution presents to the payments industry, and provides examples of how the payments industry is preparing to capture the IoT opportunity.",Internet of Things (IoT); authentication; commerce orchestration; payments; tokenisation
,2017,The future of digital retail payments in Europe: A place for digital cash?,"This paper provides a perspective on the potential for central bank issued digital cash as a complementary retail payments tool for Europe. The research approach begins with a comparison of different types of money and their respective characteristics, including both traditional forms of money and private digital currency such as Bitcoin. Against this backdrop and as an extension of the European Central Bank categorisation of forms of central bank issued cash, the paper elaborates the case for a central bank issued digital cash equivalent, labelled ‘d-cash’. Key questions ranging from the involvement of bank and non-bank payments service providers, to anonymity versus transparency and the role for consumer protection in d-cash are discussed. Following this theoretical analysis, the paper provides an overview of the current evolution of retail payments in Europe. The combination of infrastructure enhancements, regulatory change and technological innovation is poised to deliver more innovative services and bring more competition into the payments space. Depending on how these changes unfold over the coming years, European retail payments may be able to stand the competition with private digital currency when it comes to payments. However, in the context of the substantial cash usage in Europe, which represents significant costs to society, the idea of introducing d-cash should be explored further.",PSD2; SEPA Instant Payments; central bank issued digital money; distributed ledger technology; money; payments innovation; private digital currency
,2017,Can India get to 25 billion retail digital transaction in 2017–18?,"The government of India has set a target of 25 billion retail digital transaction for the year 2017–18 and is pushing all agencies to work towards this goal. This is an ambitious goal when one considers that India had only 9.6 billion retail digital transaction in the year 2016–17. This paper examines the last 10 years of payments system data to establish trend and identify when India is likely to reach this target of 25 billion retail digital transaction. It also examines where India stands on the Rogers diffusion innovation curve with regard to the adoption of digital payments. Drawing on statistics from the Committee on Payments and Market infrastructure, the paper discusses aspects that support the adoption of digital payments. It then proposes strategies for how India could meet the government’s goal more quickly, including pricing decisions, reducing taxation, widening access and tapping specific market segments. While this paper focuses on India, the strategies are applicable to any developing country interested in strengthening digital payments.",CPMI statistics; Immediate payments System; India; digital ID (AADHAAR) based payments; digital payments; national automated clearing house; retail payments
,2017,payments trend and developments in the Western Balkan countries: An interview with Aleksandar Birovljev,"The Western Balkan region — comprising Albania and five former Yugoslav republics — represents an emerging market for payments. Current cashless payments volumes are low and there is significant potential for the development of electronic payments. Although the six different economic and administrative areas have different potential for growth, there are many similarities between these markets, as well as a historic interconnection between their economies and business. Once businesses start to grow beyond their national borders, their expansion into neighbouring countries will be facilitated by the similar language and the interconnectivity of these markets. Cash is still king in the Western Balkans. However, the number of non-cash transaction is slowly growing. A major challenge for online payments in the Western Balkan countries relates to the high costs for processing transaction — card assessment fees are up to four times higher than in the EU. Central bank have announced plans to align domestic policies with EU regulations, such as the Interchange Regulation and PDS2, which could lead to market liberalisation and lower transaction costs.",FinConf 2017; Western Balkans; bank; cashless payments; e-commerce; fraud
,2017,The value of mobile ticketing from a public transport perspective,"Within the field of mobile payments, the market segment for mobile ticketing services is expected to grow, driven by the public transport sector. Although a large number of studies have explored the value of mobile payments to customers (ie service end users), there is a lack of research exploring the value of mobile payments and mobile ticketing for business customers (ie transport companies and retailers). This paper aims to address this gap and to explore the kinds of value that mobile ticketing services create for public transport companies. The research considers mobile ticketing services in six Northern European countries. The research findings suggest that within the business-to-business context, mobile ticketing services create multiple dimensions of value, namely enhanced technical functionality; financial value; better working environment; operational value; and reputational and customer relationship value. For passengers, meanwhile, value takes the form of convenience and service enhancement. These benefits are factors driving adoption of mobile ticketing and mobile payments services by public transport companies.",benefits; mobile payments; mobile ticketing; value
,2017,Evolution of digital payments: Early learnings from Singapore’s cashless payments drive,"This paper discusses the digital payments scenario unfolding in Singapore as the country’s government ponders the tremendous leap made by China in the digital payments space. The paper discusses possible key factors contributing to the success of digital payments in China, such as the success of WeChat, and whether this could be replicated in a country like Singapore. Although China and Singapore are vastly different in size, they share many similarities, including a strong one-party government which is actively involved in the direction and growth of the economy. Both countries share similar cultural and social influences including materialism, IT adoption and an emphasis on education. This paper focuses on small-value payments, which often represent the last mile in the evolution towards a fully cashless society. Using a comparison between China and Singapore, the paper considers those factors critical for the adoption of cashless payments, such as merchant discount rates, critical mass, point-of-sale interfaces, mass transit card, consumer behaviour and government policies.",China; QR code; Singapore; WeChat; cashless payments; digital payments evolution; mass transit payments; small-value payments
,2017,The macroeconomic impact of payments card,"This paper focuses on the macroeconomic benefits of the transition from paper-based to electronic payments, examining the impact of payments using debit and credit card on household consumption. The empirical model is based on the work of Zandi et al.1, with a considerably richer dataset in terms of the number of years and countries. The results confirm that the use of payments card has a positive impact on private consumption and gross domestic product (GDP), while finding a meaningful effect for both consumption and GDP — and a larger impact for both than found by Zandi et al. The analysis indicates that the transition to electronic payments matters for both the economy as a whole ( for GDP) and for individual families (through higher consumption). Overall, card penetration contributed to global GDP by an annual average of 0.243 percentage points, which translates into US$160bn per year. The contribution of card usage to global income approximately amounts to the 2014 GDP of Kuwait, and is slightly lower than the 2014 GDP of Bangladesh and Vietnam (US$183bn and US$185bn, respectively) and slightly higher than the 2014 GDP of Hungary and Ukraine (US$136bn and US$130bn, respectively).",consumption; credit card; debit card; economic growth; electronic payments; savings

The continuity of critical functions, in most cases, requires continuous access to the clearing, payments and settlement services that underpin them. This paper focuses on payments-specific aspects deriving from experience gained in relation to bank resolution in Italy. Drawing on these events, the paper shares some lessons learned with respect to ensuring continuity of access to payments system in the resolution phase, proposes some practical approaches to reducing operational risk during the resolution phase, and highlights some areas for improvements with possible follow-up actions.",BRRD; bank; continuity; overseers; payments; resolution
,2017,Cash management in transition: From cash management to cash process management,"Cash management plays a major role for global enterprises. Liquidity requirements, interest costs, currency risk and transactional costs are just some of the issues for these companies. This paper presents the results of a survey on the current state of cash management conducted in 32 large European enterprises. The survey analyses the maturity of the companies’ cash processes and reveals that the majority of these enterprises are on the same road: they centralise, standardise and automate their cash processes. Furthermore, they implement payments factories and in-house bank and make extensive use of cash pooling services. Consequently, they are now substantially reducing the number of servicing bank and bank account. As a result, local bank will largely be replaced by just a few major bank operating worldwide. In addition, global enterprises are facing a transition toward digital payments at the retail customer interface. The survey shows that their payments processes on the sales front are still mainly based on local subsidiaries or regional sales organisations. In the near future, however, these enterprises will have to offer digital payments across all available sales channels. Thus, integration of digital payments into global cash processes is a mandatory requirement and a further challenge not only for the enterprises, but also for major bank and FinTech companies acting in this field.",cash management; cash pooling; cash process; digital payments; in-house bank; payments factory

2-s2.0-85064214950,2018,The advent of machine payments: The right way to pay?,"As the Internet of Things and distributed ledger technology (DLT) continue to evolve, so do questions regarding the future of ‘autonomous’ machine-to-machine (M2M) payments. For example, whether machines can carry out autonomous payments, how they could carry out such payments, and indeed whether they should are all points worth consideration. While autonomous machines are often depicted as frightening images of a dystopian future, it is worth noting that M2M payments are already being implemented in closed-loop system where payments such as road tolls are made ‘on behalf ’ of the consumer. DLT-based approaches, however, remain proprietary and without any proven real-world use case, while genuinely autonomous M2M payments still belong to the world of science fiction. This opinion piece discusses M2M payments from three perspectives: the legal point of view, the functional implementation of payments system, and the social context. Specifically, it considers the declaration of will, DLT-based proprietary M2M payments, and whether people will be willing to let robots make autonomous decisions, including payments. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Autonomous agents; Contract law; Distributed ledger technology; Internet of Things; Machine-to-machine (M2M) payments

In preparation for this major date, which also saw its own instant payments platform, RT1, go live, EBA CLEARING published a white paper on pan-European infrastructure considerations. The paper focused on crucial drivers of success for instant payments and how they could best be supported in the infrastructure layer. A year after the publication of this paper, the company revisited these drivers, as well as the elements, processes and arrangements it had implemented at the level of its RT1 system in order to support them. The aim was to determine whether these measures had contributed to the uptake and smooth day-to-day processing of instant payments. The present paper provides a summary of this reality check. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Erwin Kulk; Instant payments; Pan-European; Real-time payments; RT1; SCT Inst; SEPA

Financial institutions must not only understand these developments but also the work required to find new business models and IT solutions to manage them. When it comes to such modernisation projects, this paper advocates the following: (1) watch the market vigilantly; (2) focus on the customer experience; (3) bring flexibility to investments; (4) ensure digitisation contributes to increased revenue; and (5) formulate a roadmap focused on essential concrete resources and know-how rather than vague ideas of functionality that would be nice to have. © Henry Stewart Publications.",bank industry paradigm; Customer expectations; Digital era; Frictionless processes; Modular core bank; Regulation

One such piece of legislation is the revised payments Services Directive (PSD2), which intends to further define a common legal framework for the payments market in the European Economic Area, with the aim of increasing the level of integration and efficiency in the market, as well as increasing the level of consumer protection. In this context, the enhancement of collaborative infrastructure can be the keystone to anticipate and transform the challenges of PSD2 into opportunities. This paper describes the creation of an open bank platform, called CBI Globe — Global Open bank Ecosystem, to facilitate the interconnection between bank and third parties through application programming interfaces, in line with the new directive. Using this platform, adhering parties will be able to simplify and expedite the administration of current account by offering both reporting and payments and collection services, thus exploiting the business opportunities enabled by PSD2. © Henry Stewart Publications.",APIs; Berlin Group; CBI Globe; FinTech; Open bank; PSD2; RegTech; TPP

The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) tackles the root causes of this development by helping with issues relating to due diligence and know your customer (KYC) obligations. Some actions to support the further use of the LEI are already in place, such as BIC-to-LEI mapping, the introduction of the LEI on an optional basis in SWIFT MT payments messages and the mandatory use of the LEI for reportable transaction within the European Union pursuant to the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. Nevertheless, in terms of the global distribution and promotion of the LEI, there remains much to be done. This paper argues that bank, in particular, should seize this opportunity to embrace the LEI as they have so much to gain from it, most notably with regard to customer due diligence and facilitating their internal processes. The paper also discusses what the future may hold for correspondent bank and the LEI. © Henry Stewart Publications.",AML/CFT; Correspondent bank; Due diligence; KYC; KYCC; Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)
2-s2.0-85064150120,2018,Biometrics: Modernising customer authentication for financial services and payments,"Payments stakeholders today face significant challenges to ensure that a customer is who they say they are, rather than a fraudster who has compromised the identity credentials of a legitimate customer. The strong emergence of electronic commerce where the customer is not physically present has made this challenge even more difficult. Biometrics is the use of automated system to recognise individuals based on their biological and behavioural characteristics. Advances in technology and the integration of sensors into consumer device such as smartphones have allowed biometrics to become a major authentication tool for both in-person and remote financial transaction. This paper reviews the most common biometric modalities currently in use for authenticating consumers. A high-level review of the technology utilised to support the biometric capture and analysis is provided along with a discussion of the advantages and challenges to the technology. The reader should leave with a basic understanding of how various biometric modalities work and are being used to strengthen the security of the payments system. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Authentication; Behavioural biometrics; Biometrics; Facial recognition; Fngerprint recognition; Voice recognition

The interplay between changes in regulatory, technology and consumer behaviour is driving ongoing transformation and reshaping the competitive environment. With the opening of the European payments market to third-party providers, the industry faces the advent of unprecedented competition. This paper describes the phenomenon of payments commoditisation as a consequence of these changes and possible responses to achieve successful competitive differentiation. It acknowledges data and the outcome of respective analysis as one of the key asset to competitive differentiation through value-added services. The paper discusses opportunities to leverage the significant amounts of valuable data possessed by incumbent bank and payments providers in order to ensure future competitiveness. The reader will learn about the relevance of Big Data analytics in the payments industry and the need to put powerful IT at the centre of future business operation. With payments moving to the core of digital user experiences, incumbent bank and payments providers are advised to position themselves as digital partners in their customers’ lives beyond payments transaction processing. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Big data analytics; Competitive differentiation; Open API; payments commoditisation; PSD2; Value-added services
2-s2.0-85059217912,2018,Digital currency and the concept of money as a social agreement,"The first appearance of digital ‘currency’ token following the implementation of Bitcoin was a catalyst for discussion about the nature of money and the future development of both fiat monies and central bank money. Indeed, the discussion today remains dominated by arguments concerning the definition of money and the role of central bank. However, ‘money’ must be understood as a social agreement between economic agents who confer legitimacy and value upon it by agreeing to accept it, both now and in the future. This paper presents a framework to understand money as a social agreement in the age of digitisation using four different mechanisms: game theory with token, market-driven development of account-based money, liabilities (of bank to their clients and central bank to commercial bank), and a trust-based mechanism for digital coins provided by a central institution. Any development of money in the digital age must consider its users’ perception of stability, security, convenience, freedom of choice and trust in its ‘reusability’. Complementing the current discussion within central bank, this paper considers how social dynamics in the 21st century might challenge the traditional definition and acceptance of money. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Bitcoin; Central bank digital currency; Digital currency; Digital token; Nature of money

In fact, demand for cash has risen in most advanced economies since the start of the global financial crisis. People tend to take cash for granted, but the smooth, efficient and secure distribution of cash is actually supported by a complex ecosystem known as the cash cycle. Cash is not always the most efficient payments instrument but, in most cases, it is. Among other things, this interview deals with three major trend aimed at increasing the efficiency of cash. First, central bank have been adapting their cash distribution policies with a view to increasing the velocity of banknote circulation and the efficiency of the cash cycle. Automation has been the second area of innovation. Lastly, numerous other innovation contribute to the efficiency of cash. Cash possesses unique attributes, which are mostly unmatched by alternative payments instruments. At a time when confidence in bank remains low, providing access to a product that consumers want and need could contribute to restoring bank’ the image of bank with the public. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Cash; Cash attributes; Cash cycle; Cash demand; Cash efficiency

This paper reviews the motives and grounds of the regulation in relation to issuing bank’ revenue losses. Using data collected from Visa, MasterCard and the European Central Bank over a period of eight years, the paper assesses the relationship between interchange fees and selected payments metrics. In contrast to forecasts made by the European Commission, the results indicate that short-to-mid-term issuer losses are not offset by increases in card volume. Furthermore, no quantifiable improvement in social welfare due to the regulation can be identified. Policy intervention should not rely solely on complex theoretical models. Empirical data based on industry observations must be considered. The findings call for a more conservative regulatory involvement in card payments markets. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Card payments; Europe; Issuing bank; Multilateral interchange fee; Partial rank correlation; Regulation; Two-sided markets

While China’s payments markets became dominated by large non-bank platforms like Alipay and WeChat, payments markets in Germany continued to be dominated by bank in the form of legacy payments system such as credit transfers, direct debits and — for point-of-sale payments — the bank-owned girocard debit card scheme, in addition to cash. Based on a sample of retailers in three metropolitan areas of China, this paper finds the combined market shares of Alipay and WeChat fall in the region of 55–65 per cent in various payments scenarios, both at the point-of-sale and online, thus confirming the dominance of non-bank payments service providers in these areas. In Germany, by contrast, comparable mobile payments methods have not been adopted on a broad scale. Based on empirical evidence, the paper identifies drivers and challenges of innovative mobile payments methods in the examples of China and Germany. © Henry Stewart Publications.",China; Country comparison; Innovative payments; Mobile payments; payments behaviour; Retailers

At the same time, only two-thirds of small or medium-sized enterprises accept credit card. To better understand the future development of this trend, it is important to study whether a change in merchant fees will increase credit card acceptance and thus further reduce cash use. To this end, this paper calculates the level of merchant fee where a merchant would be indifferent to accepting a credit card or cash payments, using the merchant indifference test.The study finds that the results are sensitive to the underlying assumptions. The paper also discusses the key issues of applying such a methodology to Canada. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Cash; Credit card; Merchant indifference test; Sensitivity analysis

The process applies AI within a typical online payments environment to detect fraudulent transaction in real time. The design focuses on an effective supervised learning engine with a data analytics component to support high-performance fraud detection, improving the predictive value of the original data.The design exploits the discriminant properties of customer data by finding hidden patterns. This feature significantly improves fraud detection rate and performance stability compared with a rule-based solution.The developed solution, based on an advanced AI-based technology and platform increased fraud detection rate from 85 per cent to 90 per cent (in terms of number of transaction records) and to 95 per cent in related amount volume (in terms of transaction value), while the alert rate (the percentage of daily transaction investigated manually) was reduced from 40 per cent to 10 per cent.The solution falls under the category of explainable AI because it can explain the rationale behind the decisions. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Artificial intelligence; Explainable ai; Fraud management; Machine learning; Real-time fraud detection

This paper discusses its potential impact on the 26 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that represent 99 per cent of business in the EU, and which provide two-thirds of the total private sector employment in the EU. The European Commission considers SMEs and entrepreneurship as the key to ensuring economic growth, innovation, job creation and social integration in the EU.This paper argues that for SMEs, compliance with the GDPR represents a far greater burden of regulatory duty than is appropriate and may impede their development and competitiveness against larger firms that can afford dedicated staff to manage the process, implementation and ongoing supervision of GDPR compliance. The paper looks at several areas where cloud technology has enabled SMEs to compete and win against larger global players, but suggests that under the GDPR, such technology may entail greater cost and resources. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Cloud service providers; Consent; E-privacy; Personal impact assessment; SMEs

It finds that only a small portion of inward remittances are processed via formal remittance services, with the bulk going through informal channels, which are unsafe and inefficient. Existing commercial bank channels are rarely used, and international money transfer operators have a limited presence in Lesotho. Innovative channels, such as the mobile money services and Shoprite cash-to-cash services, have the potential to substantially formalise inward remittances and encourage the move towards digital payments and broader financial inclusion. However, the market faces numerous challenges, including: a high preference for cash; the limited number of access points and agent networks outside of urban areas; and inefficient interoperability between the commercial bank and mobile network operators, as well as between mobile network operators themselves. This paper argues that the authorities in Lesotho should enhance the payments system infrastructure, harmonise the legal and regulatory framework, enhance financial literacy and encourage remittance service providers to be more active in the remittance market. In addition, the authorities should clarify the consumer protection and dispute resolution framework for remittance services as well as other financial services. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Cross-border remittances; Economic and social development; Formal remittances; Lesotho; Regulation

The change to smart money — money with a memory, interfaces and the ability to make decisions — has wide-ranging implications, starting with the disruption of the post-1971 world of purely fiat currency. Given that these technology mean that literally anyone can create smart money, who will? Is the future Bitcoins or Brit-coins? This paper explores the new technology of cryptocurrency ‘token’ before going on to explore five potential issuers of token-based smart money: central bank, commercial bank, cryptography, companies and communities. Looking at each of these in some detail, it concludes that the apparently radical scenario of multiple currency more closely linked to communities is both plausible and, for a number of reasons, desirable. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Cryptocurrency; Digital money; Electronic money; Fiat currency; token

However, the era of lightweight innovation and limited advancements in payments technology is coming to an end. The revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) gives third parties the opportunity to develop, launch and become the preferred payments channel in regions where no alternative exists. Increasing smartphone adoption and internet access will see mobile become the dominant channel for everyday purchases. As payments are commoditised, the value of this channel is no longer limited to transaction fees. Instead, it is derived from user volume and data.Tech giants, such as Facebook, Google and Apple, recognise that data equal power and have made evidential steps toward becoming payments powerhouses. bank bring formidable strengths to the payments arena. There are considerable benefits and revenue sources available to those that mobilise their long-term payments channels. Partnering with FinTech allows bank to quickly become agile and launch cost-efficient minimum viable products and to test new ideas.

It also discusses DLT solutions that are being tested to overcome these limitations. However, this technology alone cannot overcome liquidity issues in local markets — especially emerging markets. Presently, bank and payments providers resolve these issues by prefunding account in local currency on both sides of a transaction, using something called nostro account. This is where digital asset can deliver a clear advantage when used in combination with DLT. Acting as a bridge currency, digital asset can create the necessary pools of liquidity and enable direct transaction. The future of cross-border payments will then be realised through the combination of DLT and digital asset. In this way, bank and payments providers can quickly and easily complete affordable, transparent, real-time transaction.

Users experience endless frustration with countless passwords and registration procedures. Governments suffer from poor online acceptance and merchants experience high fraud costs despite massive IT investments. Perhaps it is time to rethink the topic of identity. This paper argues that we should move from verifying the full ‘identity’ of a person or company to very specific ‘attribute verification’. This should be done not only for people and companies but also for device, apps, bots and more.The paper advocates the use of intelligent data-driven authentication and a shift away from the current dependence on government-issued documents, faxes/utility bills, user ID/passwords and rigid two-factor procedures. It argues that the future should be based upon pseudonyms rather than full identification and will describe the very few occasions when full anonymisation is actually necessary. The paper proposes a federated model that connects the many current silos of organisations providing attributes with the many organisations that wish to use them, employing an open four-corner model instead of today’s point-to-point interconnections.

It opens with a discussion about the concept of money, its functions and the underlying theories. The analysis then discusses the concept of CBDCs and the various types of CBDC that are currently being advanced. The paper questions whether adoption of a pan-European CBDC would require a harmonised approach, or whether national solutions alone could suffice. The paper describes the legal aspects of the European payments landscape that would need to be adjusted in order to settle CBDC transaction without posing risk to payments system participants. The paper concludes by suggesting that this new form of money could broaden the discussions surrounding the institutional theory of money, and that a more cautious approach to the subject would be more likely to incline the European legislator to consider amendments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central bank, should any decision be taken to embrace a CBDC.

Three main dimensions can be applied to distinguish the concepts: token versus account, proprietary/closed-loop versus interoperable, and settlement-based versus messages between local pools. While no current alternative could completely replace the existing system for the time being, close monitoring of the way forward and more research will be needed to derive more insight into this complex challenge. .","Centralised platforms, Correspondent bank, International payments, Libra, Token economy"

However, recent and upcoming changes have made understanding the EU regulatory landscape more important than ever.A firm’s ability to keep abreast of such changes, assess their potential impact on its business and develop and implement plans to adapt to new requirements can be a key factor in its overall success or failure in European markets.This paper provides an overview of the following topics and examines their relevance to firms operating in the payments sector: the revised payments Services Directive (PSD2), the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR), regulation of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoasset, other EU regulation relevant to payments service providers and system, and the impact of the UK’s departure from the EU (Brexit). .","Brexit, Compliance, Cryptocurrencies, Interchange, Licensing, PSD2, Regulation"

This paper describes the role of the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system in a world of instant payments. It describes features that characterise RTGS and instant payments, and argues that there is still a role for RTGS.

The use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a key element in legal entity identity management within the payments life cycle can help solve these issues. Including LEIs in the payments life cycle provides verified, authoritative information about the exact legal entity involved in payments transaction to the parties involved in the process. The Payments Market Practice Group considers the migration to the ISO 20022 payments messaging standard, and use of the LEI within that migration, a key opportunity to rethink how and what reference data are sourced and used for legal entity identification, and to make real enhancements to such identification and messaging processes for the payments community. .","Adoption, Benefits, ISO 20022, LEI, Payments, PMPG"

FinTech 2.0 companies are able to capture more of the payments economics and offer merchants a better experience. While a software company can pursue multiple pathways to offer payments to its customers, the only way to fully capture the benefits of FinTech 2.0 is to become a payments facilita-tor (payfac). Thanks to the emergence of dedicated infrastructure providers, this is now much easier. This paper discusses the historical, current and future state of merchant acquiring distribution, the benefits of new-age software-based distribution models, and the options available to software companies to capitalise on payments in this new model. .","Integrated payments, payments facilitators, Payments, Verticalisation"

In this respect, the paper discusses the role of such drivers as increasing regulation, digitalisation, the drive for efficiency, and the general lack of agility among incumbent financial services providers to respond to changing corporate needs and expectations. The paper also discusses how these factors have driven financial institutions to invest in and partner with specialist FinTech, and consequently, elevated investment levels and investor interest in the B2B FinTech space. The paper describes how these trend are likely to develop in the future and how it will become ever more important for incumbent financial services providers to partner with FinTech to offer niche and tailored solutions to remain competitive. This paper also discusses what the future will look like and how the landscape will look significantly more intricate in the future. Consequently, the authors discuss how consolidation within the B2B FinTech space is expected to continue, while the emergence of tech giants in the financial services space represents the potential for a TechFin future. .","B2B FinTech, Cooperation, Future of FinTech, Investment, Payments, Regulation"

This indicator demonstrates that the customers of public and private sector bank show a preference for cash transaction over non-cash transaction, while the customers of foreign bank prefer non-cash transaction over cash transaction. The estimated cash preference ratio shows a declining trend over time, in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s pro-gress towards a less cash-dependent economy. The empirical results reveal a sharp decline in cash preference during the period of demonetisation, however, cash preference marginally increased during the post-demonetisation period. The study also finds that customers of public sector bank have the highest cash preference, followed by the customers of private sector bank. The authors propose the introduction of an oversight mechanism to identify the root causes of high cash preference, and the provision of remedial measures, such as investment in the infrastructure to support non-cash transaction and educating customers about the benefits of a cashless economy.-.

Financial services providers are already utilising AI to reduce costs, handle compliance pressures, and improve their relationships with customers. Nevertheless, given the extent to which AI could change financial services’ operation, it is essential that organisations consider the implementation of AI technology from a holistic perspective. This paper provides a contextual overview of the rise of AI and aims to frame AI as not simply a cost-saving auto-mation tool, but as a fundamental shift with many potential considerations, for which the organisation must take account.

The paper defines how the locus of control in DLT shifts from centralised system administrators to end users, while the locus of knowledge shifts from organisational to smart-contract programmers’ knowledge. The radical implementation of DLT is depicted as a single-layer network where intermediaries are eliminated from the payments cycle, while the conservative approach is described as the gradual application of some DLT components into existing ecosystems. Both designs are briefly discussed from the perspective of database centrality, technological literacy and quality assurance. The paper then compares DLT and instant payments schemes through the lens of standardisation, market adoption and platformisation. The paper shows that to be successful, both instant payments system and DLT need to gain traction in the market, and that service fragmentation must be resolved by uni-fying the market. The paper ends by contrasting the various components of instant payments and DLT system, and concluding that while DLT remains an evolving technology, instant payments system will continue to play a more prominent role in the market.

At the same time as (erroneously) treating them like conventional cartel prices, they have also mandated an upper ceiling for them — effectively legitimising the concept. As this paper demonstrates, classifying MIFs with standard cartel pricing is a categorical error. A capped MIF is simply one ingredient of a well-functioning card payments system. Indeed, without MIFs, payments markets suffer free-rider problems and high transaction costs. To illustrate how MIFs curtail the tendency of prices to move upward, the paper examines the German ATM system before 2011. Finally, the paper argues that the current regulatory approach may lead to the demise of those European card schemes that are currently under pressure from MasterCard and Visa.

Adoption of ISO 20022 — a newer, richer and more flexible standard — will enable market infrastructure to offer customers more innovative and efficient services. Reflecting this trend, SWIFT is embarking on the phased migration of payments messages to ISO 20022. However, the success of ISO 20022 risk creating problems if there is too much variation in the way it is implemented. Such variation would fundamentally undermine the value of the standard itself. This article will explore how extensive consultation with the industry has provided a framework for SWIFT’s ISO 20022 migration strategy. A collaborative approach to standards and adoption of global market practice is being taken to build on the success of ISO 20022 and ensure innovation continues in the cross-border payments landscape.

This consolidation will require a single gateway to access the various system, the introduction of centralised liquidity management, and the standardisation of all messaging in accordance with the ISO 20022 universal financial industry message scheme. The project will have a significant impact on bank, affecting almost their entire payments IT infrastructure. It will also change business rules and processes, and impact on their liquidity management. Clearly, bank will have to dedicate significant resources to fulfil their obligations before the actual migration takes place in November 2021. The project follows a global trend for the migration of high-value and cross-border payments to the ISO 20022 standard, with the Dollar Zone, Sterling Zone and SWIFT all starting similar projects.

As RTGS data are available to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on an almost daily basis, such data can be used to construct timely GDP forecasts. This paper reports some initial results on using payments system data to enhance GDP forecasts.

2-s2.0-85064177642,2019,Cash use across countries and the demand for central bank digital currency,"Within any country, the demand for central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be influenced by trend in the level of cash use. While having access to digital currency is more convenient than having to travel to an automated teller machine, this only makes digital currency as convenient as a bank debit card — not better. Demand for digital currency will thus be weak in countries where the adoption of cash substitutes (eg card, electronic money, mobile phone payments) has suppressed demand for cash. By contrast, where cash use is high due to a lack of substitutes, demand for digital currency should be stronger. Building on the observation that demand for CBDC is tied to the current level of cash use, this paper uses four measures to assess trend in the demand for cash in 11 countries. A tentative forecast of cash use is also made. After showing that declining cash use is largely associated with demographic change, the study ties the level of cash use to the likely demand for CBDC in different countries. In this process, it is suggested that one measure of cash use is more useful than the others. .","Cash forecasting, Cash use, Central bank digital currency"

This paper discusses the expectations that e-cash would need to meet, from a user perspective, and argues that e-cash would need to have more in common with modern account-based electronic and mobile account payments than with traditional cash. Were central bank to launch e-cash, they would be in direct competition with private payments services. A successful e-cash service would therefore require a competitive edge over private electronic payments services. This would create a risk of market distortion for both payments and deposit services. Regulatory issues such as know-your-customer requirements and account/transaction liabilities would play a major role in e-cash services. Central bank e-cash would have to fulfil the basic payments instrument requirements of a sufficiently large segment of the payments market. .","Central bank digital currency, Digital cash, E-cash, Electronic legal tender, Electronic payments instrument regulation"

Specifically, in their capacity as settlement agencies and operators of their national RTGS system, many central bank are today considering the merits of extending RTGS access to retail payments service providers (PSPs) other than commercial bank, to include emerging companies that apply technology to the provision of payments or payments-related services. This paper frames the issue within the broader context of whether, and to what extent, access to RTGS system should be extended to non-bank PSPs. Decades of experience with RTGS system across countries in different stages of financial sector development, in an increasingly globalised marketplace, have revealed a number of practical problems for central bank, the direct users of RTGS system, and other beneficiaries of their services. This paper draws on such experience and practice.

Before the pandemic, modern business practices, particularly related to administrative activities, had become highly centralised, often compartmentalised in ‘shared service’ centres.

At the centre of these adjustments is the use of commercial card technology, a payments method well suited to emergency situations and a dispersed workforce with the flexibility to meet evolving user demands. This paper presents results from a recent survey of North American card programme administrators about how organisations have adapted and are continuing to adapt their commercial card programmes to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The paper concludes with the observation that a FedCoin solution may offer the most opportunities for innovation and economic growth.The idea of some form of FedCoin as a platform not just for smart money but very smart money is appealing in the central bank context as a way to implement the population-scale electronic cash system required to deliver a national digital currency. This is important because the renewed focus of central bank on the potential for central bank digital currency should highlight the potential for electronic cash as a platform for new opportunities and a new generation of financial services, not simply a more efficient means to implement domestic retail payments.

The authors argue that without careful strategic choices around how digital cash payments schemes will emerge, the uptake and usage of such instruments is likely to be low — despite their potential to promote greater financial inclusion and innovation. The payments scheme represents those elements beyond just the technology that enables transaction to flow between participants. In developing these schemes, four the-oretical options are proposed for central bank to consider, based on two strategic choices. Either central bank take the lead in creating such schemes or leave it to the market to create the schemes. They also need to consider whether to leverage existing schemes or introduce new ones. Based on these two choices, the authors provide four options for central bank: a market-led passive approach, a market-led competitive approach, an authority-led integrative approach, or authority-led developmental approach. The choice of option is depen-dent on a number of factors, including (1) the policy imperatives behind introducing digital cash, (2) the competencies that exist within the central bank and (3) the existing electronic payments competition landscape.

2-s2.0-85078892357,2020,"A global stablecoin: Revolutionary reserve asset or reinventing the wheel? Received (in revised form): 24th october, 2019","Since early 2019, when Facebook announced its intention to design a payments system based on blockchain technology, the global financial regulatory establishment has begun to take seriously the arguments for disintermediated payments system. This paper examines the geopolitics, legal concepts and monetary policy that have informed the emergence of ‘global stablecoins’ such as Facebook’s Libra project, central bank digital currency and the single hegemonic currency (SHC) recently proposed by Mark Carney of the Bank of England. It first analyses private and state-backed cryptocurrencies, and suggests that state-backed cryptocurrencies are more likely to fit the role of true digital currency. Focusing on the distinctions between central bank digital currency on a national level and the proposed SHC as a new global reserve asset, the paper sets out the legal structure of the SHC based on the ‘claims’ model, but infers from its similarities to special drawing rights that the full development of such an asset would be opposed by domestic policy interests. Finally, the paper assesses the prospects of the SHC based on the ‘objects’ model. It tentatively concludes that the features of the objects model that distinguish it from the claims model greatly improve its prospects of success. Specifically, the generation of network effect value, as a substitute for the convertibility value of special drawing rights, may be the decisive contribution of blockchain technology to a truly global reserve currency.

2-s2.0-85090746924,2020,Open bank: The rise of the cloud platform,"This paper explores how traditional bank system architectures will be affected by the emergence of open bank. Platform models for open bank are proposed that accommodate both sup-ply and demand-side solutions. On the demand side, the network effects of open bank platforms and their limitations are discussed. Using a feed-back model of platform behaviour, it is suggested that the long-term success of open bank can be directly coupled to the emergence of such platforms and their regulatory scope. To inform the architectures to support open bank, the unique trans-actional characteristics of open bank solutions are determined. The essential role of cloud technologies in meeting these characteristics and hence the propensity for their use in the implementation of open bank platforms is illustrated. Specific types of open bank platforms are then described in terms of their essential architectural components and collaborations. The benefits to account servicing payments service providers and to third-party providers in adopting such open bank platforms are highlighted.

With many other system currently under development, this number could exceed 100 in the next few years. Many countries without a widely available and accessible infrastructure for payments acceptance are leveraging RTRPS to build applications that employ QR codes or other means to transform payments. Many other countries have also been leveraging the RTRPS infrastructure to integrate e-money institutions or FinTech into the payments ecosystem, to drive competition and innovation and to improve financial inclusion. In this way, faster and real-time payments system are becoming an increasingly important critical national infrastructure and hence vital for enabling economic development. Thus, as economies leverage these system, it is essential that they be dependable.This paper investigates the dependability of faster payments based on market research findings from six countries — three with developed economies (Australia, Japan and the UK) and three with developing economies (India, Mexico and Thailand). Based on the findings, the paper dis cusses policy implications and suggests approaches to implementing real-time payments system.

Dutch financial institutions have since started to monitor developments in quantum computing and are seeking to understand the implications for their interbank business processes.This paper looks at how bank and payments institutions can anticipate how quantum computing will evolve and respond accordingly, even though developments remain ongoing. To gain and maintain a good understanding, the Dutch Payments Association brings together quantum computing experts and experts from financial institutions to discuss the impact of quantum computing advancements on the industry. The key deliverable is to offer an approach to dealing with the threats associated with quantum computing, so that payments system can continue securely and undisturbed. As this paper will discuss, this has resulted in a quantum readiness programme and seven so-called low-regret moves.

A common theme of those responses is to lock down consumers, largely confining them to their homes. This paper explores what the COVID-19 lockdown could mean for consumer behaviours, and therefore by implication, for payments. In this period of lockdown, consumer needs do not go away — but how those needs are met and how those solutions are accessed could change radically. This situation will favour digital business models with delivery services, over physical stores, restaurants and other venues. payments providers are likely to see a rapid change in the mix of payments towards contactless and e/m-commerce payments. This paper argues that it is important not to lose sight of the strategic implications of what could be a profound change in how we live our lives and our relationship with digital technology. .","Behaviours, payments, Consumer, Contactless, Digital, E-commerce, Pandemic"

After reviewing the relevant literature, including the latest contributions on the topic, the paper takes a new ‘payments perspective’ to the issue and investigates how the role that bank play in payments system affects the way they create money. Through this new perspective, the paper analyses how bank’ payments obligations and the rules governing their settlement determine (and constrain) the extent to which each bank can exercise its power to create money. The paper also analyses how electronic monies and central bank digital currency may impact the creation of money by bank. Aside from contributing to the understanding of the critical topic of money creation, the paper’s ‘payments perspective’ explains the uniqueness of bank, even in today’s fast-evolving FinTech world, and provides a key to understand the impact of FinTech on money and credit supply in contemporary economies. More broadly, the paper underscores the relevance of payments system analysis for macroeconomic theory and practice, pointing to the need to better integrate the two disciplines. .","Bank money creation, Central bank digital currency, Demand deposits, E-money, Financial intermediaries, Funding, payments and settlement system"

This paper describes the impact of PSD2 on online payments by documenting the impact of PSD2 on the market for payments initiation services, both now and into the future. PSD2 has formalised the relationship between bank and FinTech by establishing open bank, thereby providing open access to customer account data and payments infra-structure. The general response of Europe’s bank-ers to PSD2 is one of uncertainty. While there is considerable uncertainty about both the gravity and timing of the threats to emerge under PSD2, the new regulation opens highly attractive opportunities for established payments organisations.

In parallel, digital platforms have begun to launch dedicated payments platforms and payments apps. These new platforms share two characteristics: (1) ‘reverse value creation’ and (2) services that are ‘free’ for consumers, but which cost merchants to accept. This development has changed the business paradigm for payments models: as payments has become commoditised, merchants must offer the full spectrum of payments options demanded by consumers. In the light of this new economic reality, the interchange fee model is increasingly looking like a hangover from the last century. New business models are needed for the payments industry to stay competitive, but also to leverage Europe’s advanced payments infrastructure in the digital age. This comment piece provides a personal opinion about the future of payments business models informed by two developments: the shift from plastic (ie card) to mobile device as the dominant mode of payments, and the shift from schemes with interoperable participants to centralised platforms based on new digital models of value creation.

One stated aim of this legislation was to create room for innovation in technology and business models in order to give account holders more choices and more direct control regarding access to their account information and ways of initiating payments transaction. Although an evolving array of new services and service providers has emerged over the past few years, the market remains in an early phase of experimentation. Nevertheless, information about the range of newly licensed service providers in the EU, and their business models, provides some insights into how the market is evolving and how it is reacting to recent regulatory and market infrastructure changes introduced through the PSD2 and open bank architecture. This paper reviews the population of payments institutions that have recently obtained authorisation to provide payments initiation or account information services in the EEA.

This system, known as CodeCash, separates account funds into distinct, independent parts, with each of these represented by a cash sequence, or 20-digit distinct, randomly generated numerical series. Each associated with a value up to a specific amount determined by the bank, these cash sequences are given to the client to use as spendable funds, with their hashes being stored in the account and used for verification and value deduction during trans-actions. Utilising a non-device-verifiable pass-word on each transaction, the CodeCash system offers a secure method of transaction and transfer that, even if disrupted or attacked, yields minimal gains to the attacker, with the total amount of losses from theft being limited to the total value of cash sequences stored digitally on the particular device. Furthermore, a method of storing cash sequences on offline hard drives is also introduced, with this method providing clients the option to shield funds from almost any known type of digital fraud. .","Cash sequences, Digital fraud, Mobile payments, payments security, Tokenisation"

This paper, however, proposes an alternative way forward. Pointing to the various innovation developed and launched by the payments industry over the last decade, this paper argues that rather than waiting for digital currency to reach maturity, it makes more sense to explore how existing payments tools can be used to create programmable money. Indeed, the paper suggests that by leveraging such recently delivered building blocks as instant payments, openbank application programming interfaces and request to pay, the industry can create programmable money already — with the added benefit of faster time to market. Specifically, the paper contends that request to pay, and the underlying four-corner model that creates a level playing field for solution providers, is the best means to drive forward the programmable money journey.","API, Application programming interface, CBDC, Digital currency, Distributed ledger technology, DLT, Instant payments, Programmable money, Request to pay"

This study looks at the challenges that instant payments system may face in developing economies like Colombia as they advance further into the person-to-business (P2B) transaction space. Using a survey of Colombian merchants, the study explores the factors associated with merchants’ propensity to adopt instant payments and identifies those associated with the adoption of electronic payments alternatives. The study finds that instant payments system will require a broad strategy if they are to penetrate the P2B space, as they will have to compete with the low marginal costs and immediacy offered by cash and the high levels of informality in the commerce sector, especially for micro businesses. Furthermore, instant payments system will have to meet merchants’ high expectations with respect to enabling access to other financial services, enhancing competitiveness and increasing their bottom line.","Bank transfers, card, Cash and electronic payments, Faster payments, Instant payments, Merchants, Mobile payments, Retail payments"

Recent payments infrastructure modernisation efforts have identified one such standard, ISO 20022, as particularly effective at enabling richer data collection, which in turn has the potential to increase payments system interoperability and efficiency. The adoption of a new messaging standard has broad implications for both domestic and cross-border payments system, with applications not only for faster payments system but for retail payments more broadly. However, while the benefits for financial services will be net positive, benefits will be limited for domains already using international standards (ie retail card payments).

In an economy such as the USA, which produces nearly US$100tn of non-cash payments annually, changes to the way that consumption is conducted have potentially large effects on both cost and risk for financial institutions, payments networks and consumers. This paper uses data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to identify which segments of the population are most likely to maintain these new habits, and which are more likely to shift. While it is still too early to make definitive conclusions, this paper identifies trend that may provide insights into future developments in this area","Cash, Consumer spending, payments habits, Payments"
2-s2.0-85126554449,2021,"Do we need a digital euro, or a digitisation of payments?","With the exception of cash, payments have been ‘digital’ for decades. This raises the ques-tion whether the ‘digital euro’, as proposed by the European Central Bank, is actually needed, and if so, where the demand comes from. This opinion paper examines this question from five perspectives — structural, regulatory, monetary, financial and geo-political — and compares the proposed features with the actual benefits. These five perspectives lead to five antagonisms: (1) centralisation of the current two-tier financial system vs market-driven innovation, (2) a stand-alone digital euro vs the comprehensive European Markets in Crypto-asset regulation, (3) the attractiveness of a digital euro vs its cash-like lim-itations, (4) a digital euro ‘free of charge’ vs the question of funding, and (5) a competition of cur-rencies vs a competition of payments instruments. While other parts of the world plan to develop innovation with automated payments integrated in cross-industry process chains, the debate about a digital euro seems to forget the ‘voice of the customer’. With this in mind, this paper suggests that a digital euro (as currently proposed) does not provide tangible benefits, and that Europe needs more options for digital payments if it is to stay competitive in today’s global economy.","CBDC, Digital euro, Digitisation of payments, MiCA, SEPA Instant Payments"
2-s2.0-85126554267,2021,The evolving role of the ‘collecting model’ in the payments service provider market,"Many payments service providers (PSPs) are investing in the extension of their value chain by adopting the so-called ‘collecting model’. In contrast to conventional e-commerce PSPs, collecting PSPs, simplify payments processes for their clients, in addition to optimising merchant processes in general. Using the Dutch-based Adyen as a case illustration, this paper gauges the longer-term prospects of this service model. The study concludes that the collecting model will command a larger market share going forward, although it is better suited to some sectors rather than others. .","Adyen, Collecting model, Collecting PSP, Digital payments, E-commerce payments, Mobile payments, payments service providers"

Most notably, central bank calibrating the design criteria for CBDC must strike a balance between data protection and the individual’s right to privacy on the one hand, and the prevention of financial crime on the other. In this regard, there are — from a technical and governance point of view — a number of possible solutions. By way of illustration, this paper constructs three exem plary and simplified privacy scenarios. The paper also describes the need for standards to ensure the responsible treatment of data, and clear rules guaranteeing that access is restricted to public authorities fulfilling their mandates. When it comes to protecting user privacy in a CBDC system, this paper argues that independent cen tral bank are ideally positioned to serve as an honest broker. In this respect, gaining the public’s trust and acceptance will be a key challenge for central bank.","Anonymity, Central bank digital currency (CBDC), Central bank, Privacy, Retail pay ments"

Since 2020, however, progress has entered a new phase, with bank from five European countries announcing the implementation of the European Payments Initiative (EPI). This paper describes what happened to the ECPS prior to the turn of the millennium and how things have developed since then. It then goes on to analyse the challenges the EPI must overcome to become an ECPS, the success of which would bring a degree of European sovereignty over payments.","Acquiring, Card payments, European payments scheme, Instant payments, Internet payments, Mobile payments, payments scheme, payments service provider"

As this paper argues, the convenience and speed provided by automatic and online payments do not benefit all US consumers equally. Unbanked consumers lack access to most payments methods and hence use cash or prepaid card to pay their bills. Low-income consumers are more likely to pay in person, use significantly more cash, and are less likely to set up automated or online bill payments, regardless of whether they have a bank account.","Bill payments, Consumer payments, payments choice, payments preferences"
2-s2.0-85126531295,2021,The phenomenon of de-risking: Unintended consequences and possible solutions,"Global commerce relies on correspondent bank to execute international transaction. Due to the increasing cost of compliance, however, some US-based global financial institutions have been terminating their correspondent bank relationships — a practice known as de-risking. In some cases, correspondent bank have even terminated their relationships with central bank. This kind of situation creates systemic risk at a country level, and central bank are looking at alternatives to better serve the needs of their respective financial system. This paper analyses prior work and surveys on the magnitude of de-risking, and cross-references the findings with recent surveys conducted in the Dominican Republic and Argentina to determine whether market failures and systemic risk are inevitable. The results indicate that while the situation is not yet catastrophic, it is sufficiently precarious that foreign countries that rely on the US dollar should start looking for alternative solutions for global correspondent bank immediately. The paper also describes some of the alternatives currently available, including intervention from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, regional payments system, and smaller US correspondents.","De-risking, Financial institutions, Global correspondent bank, International trade, Regional payments infrastructure, Remittance"
2-s2.0-85125947278,2021,An integrated approach for electronic identification and central bank digital currency,"This paper outlines a proposal for how to imple-ment Central Bank Digital currency (CBDC) based on open bank standards and supports both account-based and token-based CBDC mod-els, transacting online and offline with immediate finality, while recognising the European PSD2 requirements, including (multi-factor) strong customer authentication (SCA).The authors recognise the limitations with current smartphone technology with respect to deploying trusted applications and in performing the role of a qualified signature creation device-highly relevant to offline scenarios. In some cases, the authors recommend regulatory review, in others they recommend taking full advantage of the existing capabilities of the sep-arated secure execution environment by dividing the control of a CBDC transaction between both payee and payer device, so that if one device was compromised, this does not undermine the whole transaction. It balances the need for anonymity with financial crime regulatory requirements and suggests that a CBDC wallet can be enriched with eID capabilities, or vice versa. The wallet is bound to the person’s identity, their device and software via a chain of trust (eIDAS for the EU or similar for non-EU countries). The authors combine this with self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles to maximize privacy and minimize information sharing with a third party.

Access to financial products or even financial institutions is very limited in some countries, constraining both individual and company access to capital.This phenomenon has only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is especially problematic for those individuals and companies with largely offline businesses. This paper argues that the roots of change are starting to take hold, as payments service providers and business-to-business players are helping bridge the digital divide. Payments services are increasingly likely not to be standalone products, but rather to include a myriad of both financial and non-financial products and services that can help individuals and companies increase their economic empowerment.","Digital payments, Financial inclusion, Platforms, South-east Asia"

The paper describes several key findings from the survey, most notably that US consumers increased their cash holdings at the time of the pandemic lockdowns. More consumers held at least some cash, and almost half of consumers had more than US$100 in spring and late summer 2020, compared with one-third in autumn 2019. In spring, just one third of consumers reported making an in-person payments, compared with almost everyone in autumn 2019. People who paid in person, however, were about as likely to use cash in the spring as they had been in the previous autumn. Payments of unemployment benefits appear to have affected cash holding for some consumers. Similar to the behaviour of some consumers in advance of hurricanes, some consumers reported getting precautionary amounts of cash. ","Cash, Consumer behaviour, COVID-19, US currency in circulation"

This paper discusses the ECB’s report, before examining other global CBDC initiatives and then proposing a possible blueprint for a digital euro. The paper argues that if the key parties continue to combine their expertise, Europe will not only have a world-class blueprint for a digital euro, but also a template for the creation of a future digital world currency based on European design principles.","CBDC, Central bank digital currency, Digital currency, Digital euro, Electronic identity, Euro area"

These risk have increased due to the increasingly sophisticated methods malefactors are using in their attacks. While payments system operators are modernising their infrastructure in response to these threats, there is still work to be done. payments system control and governance frameworks must be strengthened in accordance with guidance from regulators and marketplace best practices. There is also an urgent need to examine the liability frameworks under which payments system operate as some may not be adequate to protect participants and owners from either business-as-usual or catastrophic losses, and participants may be expected to bear uncapped, unpredictable liability for losses. This paper suggests that all participants in the payments ecosystem should consider the strength of their resources to cover potential losses, adopt guidance on endpoint security provided by the regulatory community, and engage in a collaborative effort to ensure that appropriate incentives exist for all parties to maintain enhanced defences against fraud and cyber attack, thereby better supporting financial stability.","Controls, Cyber attack, Financial stability, Fraud, Governance, Liability, Wholesale payments"

To survive, bank must therefore embrace new strategic initiatives. This paper discusses how bank can establish themselves as the trust anchor in the digital economy and secure their future relevance and business. Specifically, it presents a strategic roadmap for bank to assume the role of ‘data custodian’ in the everyday lives of their customers. This role will enable them to provide the secure and reliable exchange and management of data-driven digital transaction across all sectors in the digital economy. The proposed roadmap describes the key implications for bank to succeed in their new role.

2-s2.0-85108417171,2021,Innovation and competition in payments: Evolving policy challenges,"Technology-led innovation in payments has been a constant over history. Nevertheless, the ongoing process of digital transformation is proving to be radically different from the previous waves, as it is leading to a more profound reconfiguration of the financial industry. By facilitating the entrance of new players, particularly FinTech and big tech companies, technological innovation in payments has increased competition, further inducing innovation and efficiency gains. Despite having obvious benefits, payments system innovation and the associated changes in competition dynamics have implications for consumer protection, financial stability and market integrity that require an adequate response from supervisors and policymakers. This paper explores how the digital transformation of financial services has led to the opening up of the payments market to new providers, initially specialised FinTech companies and increasingly large technology conglomerates. The paper also discusses how regulators and policymakers have already responded to the evolving nature of the payments ecosystem, and key issues that policymakers should take into consideration to define a forward-looking approach. Finally, it calls for a balanced regulatory intervention that promotes electronic payments adoption and responds to the challenges posed by this unprecedented transformation trend in payments. .","Competition policy, Digital markets, Financial regulation, Payments"

It considers the policy issues and choices associated with crypto-currency, stablecoins and sovereign digital currency and emphasises that there is no single model for sovereign digital currency design. While Bitcoin and its progenies could be safely ignored by regulators, Facebook’s proposal for Libra, a global stablecoin, brought an immediate and potent response from regulators globally. Any proposal by the private sector to move into the creation of currency — the traditional preserve of sovereigns — was always likely to trigger such a regulatory response, as well as the launch of sovereign digital currency by other major central bank. While China has moved first, dozens of other countries are now investigating their own central bank digital currency or other forms of sovereign digital currency. This paper argues that central bank should first focus not on rolling out novel new forms of sovereign digital currency, but rather on transforming their payments system. In time, domestic money and payments system are expected to evolve so that central bank cooperate with (new and old) private entities to launch digital currency that better underpin monetary and payments system at the domestic, regional and international levels. .","Blockchain, Central bank digital currency, COVID-19, Digital yuan, Libra, Payments, Sovereign digital currency, Stablecoins"

It employs a mixed-methods approach based on 14 qualitative interviews with specialists from the financial service sector and a quantitative online survey with 617 participants. The aim is to better understand the factors enhancing and inhibiting the growth of proximity mobile payments solutions, and to generate insights regarding the characteristics of early adopters of Apple Pay in Germany. The authors investigated a range of factors from existing technology acceptance research as well as additional aspects concerning brand perception and sociodemographic factors to identify significant differences between users and non-users of Apple Pay. The most pronounced differences concerned personal willingness to innovate, followed by perceived concerns regarding the risk associated with mobile payments, the perception of Apple as a secure provider, the perceived trustworthiness of technology providers in general, social influences, gender, and the user’s desire to be perceived as tech-savvy. Additionally, the perceived benefits of mobile payments, reasons for non-usage, as well as further potential value-added services to enhance future user experience were analysed and appropriate recommendations derived. .","Apple Pay, Diffusion of innovation, Mobile payments, NFC, Proximity mobile payments, Technology acceptance"

Are these true monies or are they just services provided by FinTech companies to facilitate the use of funds? Furthermore, who actually owns the funds that back these monies? Distinguishing between money, claims on money, and money claims that eventually become money, this paper compares the development of the above types of digital currency with bank deposits as these have evolved in the bank practice over the years. The paper points to the apparent inconsistent treatment between issuers of digital currency and bank as issuers of deposit claims, and indicates how addressing this inconsistency could change the rules that govern the provision of digital currency, reallocate the responsibilities associated with their issuance and use, and redesign the measures to protect stakeholder rights. The suggested measures call for existing regulations to be revisited in some important respects. .","Bank deposits, Customer funds, Digital currency, E-money, Stablecoins, Synthetic CBDCs"
